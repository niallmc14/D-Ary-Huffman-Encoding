q2 b) We know that the entropy must be ≤ to the length of the codewords for D=2 the expected length is: 1.9999999999999998
While the entropy is: 1.9746206684118048. Which satisfys the equation. Likewise for:

D=3:
Entropy: 1.2458469317181664
Length: 1.4145

D=4:
Entropy: 0.9873103342059024
Length: 0.9999999999999999

All satisfying that the length is ≥ the entropy.
The emprifcal values are s

q2 c) Overall the more that D increases into the functions the lower the size of the text file is in terms of encoded messages.
For q1Encode and decoded the file size is 22kb while the encoded remains at 10kb for each value of D. Otherwise then we get D=3 the file size is 14kb 
and finally we get D=4 the size of the file is 10kb which is equal to the same size of the decoded files.
